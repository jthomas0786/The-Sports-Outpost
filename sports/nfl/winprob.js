/**
 * sports/nfl/winprob.js — modeled in-game win probability for NFL football.
 *
 * Design (logistic point-edge model, reviewed for calibration):
 *  - Pre-game prior comes from de-vigged moneyline odds when present, else from
 *    each team's W-L record (shrink-pulled toward .500 and given a mild
 *    home-field edge). A 12-4 team vs a 4-12 team lands near 0.70, not 0.95.
 *  - Live: an "edge" in points is built from the current score lead, a
 *    strength-prior edge that decays as the clock runs out, and a possession
 *    edge (the football analog of MLB's base/out run expectancy — the team
 *    with the ball has positive expected points from the current drive).
 *  - The edge is squashed through a logistic whose scale widens early (a lead
 *    is worth less with lots of time left) and tightens late (a small lead
 *    late is nearly decisive). Overtime collapses to a near-coin-flip band.
 *  - O/U: the NFL slate carries no total line, so we project a final combined
 *    total from current score + league scoring rate over remaining time.
 *
 * Deterministic — no Monte Carlo, so it never flickers between polls.
